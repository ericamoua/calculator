 * when you press a button, you get a string?

 * Number('123') -> 123
 * 
 * 123 ??? 123 = ???
 * 
 * 1. entering a string
 * 2. after clicking an operator your first string turns into a number
 * 3. you start your 2nd string
 * 4. after you press enter the 2nd string turns into a number
 * 5. now you do your logic
 * 
 * Number(??) + Number(??) = ???
 * 
 * 1stString + 2ndString = ???
 * 
 * first step in the logic
 * *creat the first string
 * --when you press your #'s you put them together

let num1 = '';

//empty string because we don't know the number 

num1 + what ever the user presses = '' + '' = ''

//we need a Number not a string
//So answer will always be a Number
// answer = Number(num1) + Number(num2)
const answer;


//write down this the process and if i get stuck stop research and get back to it
